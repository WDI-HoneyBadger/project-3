## Overview

For this project we will be working in groups of 4 to create an application using Node/Express and React.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** Working in a team can be more challenging than working by yourself, but you're most likely going to find yourself working in a development team in your first job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

## Teams

I am just going throw the teams out here first:

- **Team 1** - Masarah, Layal, Abdulrab, Hamad
- **Team 2** - Mohrah, Moroj, Mohammed, Hanan
- **Team 3** - Sultan, Bader, Rawan, Jumanah
- **Team 4** - Abdulkareem, Shahad, Alanoud, Raed
- **Team 5** - Aishah, Nada, Khalid T, Nawaf
- **Team 6** - Turki, May, Munirah, Yahya
- **Team 7** - Marwah, Noorah, Khalid A, Hamoud


## Requirements

Your group must:

- **Use Postgres (pg-promise) & Express** to build an API and a **React** front-end that uses it
- Create an Express API using, **at minimum, two tables**
- Include **full CRUD functionality** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those models
- **Use your own API** by making your front-end with React
- **Third-Party API**: Use a third-party API
- **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
- Use **Figma** to create prototypes with interaction.
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard git workflow on GitHub
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible
- **New NPM package**: Use an NPM package we haven't gone over in class


## Necessary Deliverables

### For the APP:
- A **team git org** with repositories for your API and your React APP hosted on Github with frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
- A **working API**, hosted on Heroku
- A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted on surge

### For the README:
- A **link to your hosted working app**
- Explanations of the **technologies** used
- A few paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
- A link to your Figma prototype.  Feel free to add a screenshot or two of the figma prototype directly in the ReadMe for some attention-grabbing flair.
- **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
- Your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
- Your **wireframes** – sketches of  views and interfaces in your application
- Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **hurdles** your team had to overcome

### For your presentation:
- **5 minutes:** A presentation deck _- Google Slides, Keynote, or PowerPoint_
    - At least 5 slides
    - Everyone must talk! Make sure you think through your presentation so that each person has something to say.
    - Answer the following questions:
	      - What is the your app about?
	      - What features does it include?
	      - Were there any constraints you had to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
	      - Is there any other information you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you've built?
- **3 minutes:** A demo of your app
    - Show the functionality of your app!

### Project Proposals: SHARK TANK

__Your proposal should be a presentation including:__

- Name of your app / project concept
- [User stories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/) that describe how your app will be used.
- Detailed and thought out prototypes created with Figma.
- ERD's showing any relationships in your models
- A **timeline** laying out what each group member will do each day. This should specify clear features to be implemented by the end of each day.
- Foreseen challenges or obstacles
- Technology you intend to use:
    - API - **Test it with Postman**, before you present your proposal. Make sure you get the data you are looking for! [Useful resourse for public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
    - NPM package
- Any other information that will help us understand your project!

**Also send us links to your Github Org**

## Suggested Ways to Start

- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or API’s you use.**
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful.**
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined.** Remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc.?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.


## Before you Start

- **Draw ERDs (diagrams of how your tables will look)**
- Make your route tables!
- **Write user stories**
- **Write a list of 3rd party technologies** that you will be using and need to explore before you dive head first into your project
- **Write a project proposal** to present to your instructor
- **Organize the project in terms of the directory structure etc.**

## On Teamwork

This is a group project, which means that every member of each group needs to step up in order for the project to be successful. We suggest that you sit down as a group and lay out expectations of each individual as early as possible. *We will examining the `git` commit history of project carefully as a way to understand who contributed and in what capacity. What you can do to help is commit often and make your commit messages descriptive.*

The short of it is to be a good team player and pull your weight. By doing so we avoid issues after the fact.

## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. Solving problems like "how do I loop through .  Don't follow tutorials!
