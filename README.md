## Overview

For this project we will be working in groups of 3 or 4 to create an application using Node/Express and React.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** Working in a team can be more challenging than working by yourself, but you're most likely going to find yourself working in a development team in your first job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

## Teams

I am just going throw the teams out here first:

- **Team Todielina** - Todd Nakasato, Daniela Aguirre, Gina Kang
- **Team Kinissa Dananna** - Daniel Risdon, Larissa Catalano, Anna Pack, Kin Lim
- **Team J²R²** - Jon Ellsaesser, Rebekah Bae, JR Rene
- **Team Rohara Gleveline** - Yveline Say, Kiara Contreras, Rohtas Wadera, Glenn Friedman


## Requirements

Your group must:

- **Use Postgres (pg-promise) & Express** to build an API and a **React** front-end that consumes it
- **Create an Express API using, at minimum, two related tables**
- Include **CRUD functionality** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those models
- **Consume your own API** by making your front-end with React
- **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
- **Create a project board** and use it to manage team workflow
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard git workflow on GitHub
- **Designate one team member** to be in charge of managing team git workflow (the Git Shepherd)
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible
- **Auth**: A login/logout system
- **Third-Party API**: Use a third-party API, either from the frontend or the backend (if it has a key, it should be from the backend)
- **New NPM package**: Use an NPM package we haven't gone over in class


## Necessary Deliverables

### For the APP:
- A **team git org** with repositories for your API and your React APP hosted on Github with frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
- A **working API**, hosted on Heroku
- A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted on surge

### For the README:
- A **link to your hosted working app**
- A **link to your Trello board**
- Explanations of the **technologies** used
- A few paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
- **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
- Your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
- Your **wireframes** – sketches of  views and interfaces in your application
- Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **hurdles** your team had to overcome

### For your presentation:
- **5 minutes:** A presentation deck _- Google Slides, Keynote, or PowerPoint_
    - At least 5 slides
    - Use easy-to-understand language and avoid too much "technical" terminology
    - Include wireframes that shows your app
    - Answer the following questions:
	      - What is the your app about?
	      - What features does it include?
	      - Were there any constraints you had to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
	      - Is there any other information you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you've built?
- **2 minutes:** A demo of your app
    - Show the functionality of your app!

### Project Proposals: SHARK TANK ON 10/25! :calendar:

__Your proposal should be a presentation including:__

- Name of your app / project concept
- [User stories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/) that describe how your app will be used.
- Detailed and thought out wireframes.
- A **timeline** laying out what each group member will do each day. This should specify clear features to be implemented by the end of each day.
- Foreseen challenges or obstacles
- Technology you intend to use:
    - API - Test it with Postman **TONIGHT**, before you present your proposal. Make sure you get the data you are looking for! [Useful resourse for public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
    - NPM package
- Any other information that will help us understand your project!

**Also send us links to your:**

- Github Org
- Trello Board

## Suggested Ways to Start

- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or API’s you use.**
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful.**
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined.** Remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc.?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.


## Before you Start

- **Draw ERDs (diagrams of how your tables will look)**
- **Write user stories**
- **Build wireframes**
- **Write a list of 3rd party technologies** that you will be using and need to explore before you dive head first into your project
- **Write a project proposal** to present to your instructor
- **Create a project board** that outlines what steps each member will need to take and the order you plan to take them in.
- **Define a styleguide** with your team. What fonts will you use, what color schemes? Be consistent with the styling.
- **Organize the project in terms of the directory structure etc.**

## On Teamwork

This a group project, which means that every member of each group needs to step up in order for the project to be successful. We suggest that you sit down as a group and lay out expectations of each individual as early as possible. We will examining the `git` commit history of project carefully as a way to understand who contributed and in what capacity. What you can do to help is commit often and make your commit messages descriptive.

The short of it is to be a good team player and pull your weight. By doing so we avoid issues after the fact.

## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
